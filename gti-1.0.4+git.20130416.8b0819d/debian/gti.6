.SH NAME
\fBgti\fP \- Animates a car and launches git if you type 'gti' by mistake.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgti\fP is intended to catch accidental typos of 'gti' instead of 'git'. It
displays an animation of a car driving by, and then launches git. Any
parameters or arguments given to \fBgti\fP will be passed through to git.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
\fBgti\fP respects the GIT environment variable. If GIT is set, its value will
be used to launch git after the animation finishes, instead of searching for
git in your PATH.

.SH SEE ALSO
\fBgit\fP(1), \fBsl\fP(6)
